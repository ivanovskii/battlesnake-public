"""Heuristic move-selection logic for the Battlesnake.

This is a deliberately simple, rules-based policy. Everything flows through
:func:`choose_move`, which takes the raw game state and returns one of
``"up" | "down" | "left" | "right"``.

Board coordinates: ``(0, 0)`` is the bottom-left corner.
  up    -> y + 1
  down  -> y - 1
  left  -> x - 1
  right -> x + 1
